# Docs update (2025-12-16)

## Why

Refresh and expand maintainers’ architecture docs while keeping the numbered lifecycle IA intact.

## Changes

- Added `docs/04-architecture/source-tree.md` to document module boundaries and ownership of major
  folders.
- Expanded `docs/04-architecture/overview.md` with download filtering/pagination and where sync
  state is stored.
- Expanded `docs/04-architecture/server-api.md` with query params and base URL behavior.
- Updated `docs/06-delivery/local-development.md` to reflect current scripts and local server
  configuration.
- Normalized `docs/README.md` to use `npm run` as the default command prefix (with `pnpm` as an
  alternative).
