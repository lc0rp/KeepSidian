# Local Development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- `npm` (recommended; `pnpm` also works)

## Common commands

- Dev rebuild/watch: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Generate barrels: `npm run barrels`
- Run all linters: `npm run lint`
- Run tests: `npm run test`

## Notes

- Barrels are auto-generated by `barrelsby` and also run during `prebuild`.
- The Obsidian plugin entry is `src/main.ts` (re-exporting `src/app/main.ts`).
- Local server override: set `KEEPSIDIAN_SERVER_URL` (see `src/config/index.ts`).
